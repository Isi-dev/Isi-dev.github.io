    body_1: "A human being can be seen as a system whose goals are to continue to exist for as long as possible, relate with other systems to create more systems, and enjoy its existence. In order to achieve these goals in an extremely complex environment, the system is basically made up of a control and communication system (the brain, spinal cord, and nerves) which uses sensors (two eyes, two ears, a nose, a tongue, and a skin) to get information from the environment, and actuators (a mouth, two hands, and two legs) to interact with the environment.",

I wasn't surprised because I spent a lot of my time studying the bible from the age of fourteen until my mid twenties and the big book of books does contain many verses that address many aspects of life, including marriage. But these are the verses that stood out as I thought about the benefits of marriage.",

    title: "My experience during the 25th February 2023 Nigeria Presidential Election",

    body_1: "I left my house at about 0930am and took a walk to my polling unit which was at Elikpokwuodu town hall in Rukpokwu, Port Harcourt. There was no transport service and some of the streets and roads were turned into football fields by youths and children. Many people, mostly guys, were trekking to their polling units, and I saw two policemen; one parking his car in front of a house and the other standing close to the school by Market Junction in Rukpokwu. Apart from the three roadside traders I saw on my way, all other shops and businesses were closed. It was a peaceful walk, and I reached my destination at about 1015am.",
    body_2: "The polling unit was crowded. I saw three police officers (A man and two women) and about fifteen people sitting in the small town hall, while a multitude stood outside. I made my way into the hall and went through the lists of registered voters who were permitted to vote in the polling unit, but I did not find my name among the roughly 1056 names on the lists. I was certain I came to the right unit, but why was my name not on any of the lists? Just then I overhead someone say that the names of those who were to vote in my polling unit were mistakenly pasted on the wall of a nearby polling unit and vice versa. I went to the nearby polling unit and found my name there. I returned to my unit after confirming from the party agents present that there was a mix up in the names.",
    body_3: "The INEC staff arrived a few minutes to 11am. Most people rushed to form a queue while a few escorted the INEC Staff into the hall. I joined the long queue and waited for the process to commence. After about thirty minutes, I heard quarrels close to the hall. I left the queue to find out what the issue was. I learnt that the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) was not working properly and many people felt that the machine's failure was intentional. The INEC officials were making calls, moving in and out of the hall, and arguing with those who blamed them for the failure of the device. A PDP agent and his colleague, who were supposed to be monitoring the proceedings in another polling unit, entered the hall to find out why voting had not started. Then they requested that the presiding officer should give them his marker and inks because their own polling unit lacked these items and that it would be better that the election held in their polling unit than that it didn't hold in both units due to different challenges in the units. His request was denied and the Presiding Officer said he was going to get another BVAS machine.",
    body_4: "The queue dispersed after the presiding officer left, and people formed groups to debate what and who was behind the failure of the election to hold in the unit more than three hours after it was supposed to have started. The presiding officer arrived a minutes past 1230pm and people hurried to form a queue. As a gentle man I found myself close to the end of the queue. A good looking lady who captured the event on her phone asked me if we were given numbers and I told her 'no.' I may have sounded rude because I was disappointed with the poor organization of the event and I felt it should be obvious that we weren't given numbers. There was a heavy rainfall around 14pm which scattered the queue with more than fifty people taking shelter in the small hall. I joined the queue as soon as the rain stopped and found myself close to the beginning of the queue. But there was a problem; most of those who took shelter in the hall refused to leave after the rain stopped and the INEC officials attended to them. I could count up to eight queues inside the hall with people struggling and pressing tightly against each other in order to get attention from the INEC staff. The police officers did nothing but observe.",
    body_5: "The rain resumed a few minutes later, but some of us decided to remain in the queue to avoid losing our spots. Luckily for us the rain didn't last long. Unluckily for us, the queue didn't move for hours. Some people who were supposed to be behind me found a way to enter the crowded hall, get accredited, and proceeded to vote. There was a brief altercation between the policeman present and a youth who was quickly led away by his friends to prevent further escalation. To my surprise, I later saw that very youth casting his vote. Apart from the aforementioned conflict and a shouting match between two other guys, the polling unit was peaceful. It seems the heat and crowd in the hall later became unbearable for the INEC officials, so they threatened to stop the election and resume only if those in the hall left to join the queue outside. It took a while before most of the people in the hall left. I was glad until I saw many of those who left the hall forming a second queue, while others hung around the hall, looking for a way to get back in. My feet began to ache, so I left the queue to sit on a bench close to the main queue. It was a few minutes past 5pm and my pregnant wife who was alone at home kept calling to tell me to come back home.",
    body_6: "I rejoined the queue after sitting for about ten minutes. But around 0550pm, the presiding officer and his assistants left the hall, indicating they were done with the election. Some guys were trying to persuade them to continue, but I decided it was time to go home.  After standing in a queue for more than five hours, I left the polling unit without casting my vote.",
    body_7: "In a september 16 2021 article on https://www.premiumtimesng.com, the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Professor Mahmood Yakubu, was reported to have said that it took an average of just one minute for the BVAS to correctly locate a voter in the system and another two minutes to authenticate the voter. Assuming three minutes was the average time required to accredit a voter and assuming only 300 people out of the roughly 1056 registered voters in my polling unit came out to vote, it would have taken fifteen hours to successfully accredit everyone present. Why then did INEC allocate only six hours to the process? Did the commision want a maximum of 120 people to vote in a polling unit or did they forget to perform such calculations while planning for the election? It has been widely reported that there were 93,469,008 eligible voters and 176,846 polling units, resulting in an average of about 529 voters per polling unit. This number is too high for a polling unit considering the time required to attend to only 300 voters as previously mentioned. In order to achieve a good tradeoff between the costs of creating, staffing and equiping more polling units, and allocating more time to the voting process in future elections, I recommend that more polling units be created until the average number of registered voters per polling unit is about 335 (assuming sixty percent of registered voters will come out to vote) and at least ten hours should be allocated to the process, probably from 0800am to 0600pm. The registered voters should also be evenly distributed among the polling units. I see no good reason why up to 1056 people were registered to vote in one polling unit.",
    body_8: "Arriving late to work is a common practice of many Nigerians and the INEC staff assigned to my polling unit showed great disrespect to voters and may have caused unnecessary resentment by arriving a few hours after the election should have started. The mix up in the names pasted in the polling units, the malfunction of the BVAS, the absence of some materials, and the failure of the INEC officials and security operatives to organize the crowd were signs of unpreparedness. I don't know much about the content, quality and duration of the training of the adhoc INEC staff and if testing was conducted to ensure that they were well aquainted with the process, but I will suggest that the commission include, as part of the training, 'the organisation of crowds and proper formation of queues'. It should be expected that most people who come to vote will attempt to do so as qucikly as they can and this can result in people struggling, pushing, and overtaking others in the queue in order to get attention. Some guys also see this as an opportunity to feel the backsides of ladies with their fleshly weapons. To minimize these issues and make it easier for voters, an assistant presiding officer (APO) can come along with cardboard papers, cut the papers into small pieces, sign and number the pieces of paper, and issue a piece to each potential voter after checking their PVCs and confirming that they are in the right polling unit. Then a voter can proceed for accreditation after the number on the piece of paper with him or her is announced and checked by the APO. This will ensure that those who came first will be served first and the crowd will be more peaceful and less rowdy come rain or sunshine.",
    body_9: "Lastly, the purpose of security agents in a polling unit is to maintain law and order, and protect the lives and property of all those present. These agents need to be properly equipped in order to effectively carry out their duties. I might be wrong, but I think three police officers are insufficient to secure a polling unit. There should be seven or more armed security operatives per polling unit to prevent intimidation of voters and agents by political thugs. There's obviously more room for improvement of the electoral process and I have made a few recommendations, all or some of which might improve or worsen the process. Please feel free to contact me to point out my errors and suggest corrections, and also come up with better solutions. I hope for a free, fare, and transparent election, and I hope that we all join hands with whoever emerges the winner to create a better Nigeria.",
